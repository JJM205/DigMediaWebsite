<h2> Bio <h2>
<h4> I took this class because I want to learn more about Digital Media, since it seems to be future of public and professional media. I am really into music, movies, and sports. One interesting fact about me is that I won the Pitt Intramural soccer league. I just transferred into Pitt and this is my second semester. I love being in Oakland living the city life. My favorite thing to do at Pitt is go to football games with my friends.  <h4>
